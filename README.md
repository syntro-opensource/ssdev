ssdev makes Silverstripe development easy. Stop worrying about your LAMP, MAMP
or WAMP stack and start developing awesome websites and applications!

> ðŸš¨ **WANTED: Feedback from Windows & Linux users!**
>
> ssdev is extensively tested on macOS, as this is what we work on, so feedback
> from other systems is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Started
### ðŸ§© Requirements
For ssdev to work correctly, you have to install
* Docker ([installation instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)) - We recommend to install Docker desktop on Windows, as a native installation under wsl tends to not work correctly.
* Node & npm *(& npx)* ([installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

> Users on Mac or Windows will have to set up nfs. If it is not working
> out of the box, follow the steps in [this article](https://firehydrant.io/blog/nfs-with-docker-on-macos-catalina/).

### ðŸ“¦ Installation
You can run ssdev without installing it using npx:
```
npx ssdev --help
```
This works great for checking out ssdev or for issuing some commands, but
for productive development work, you should install it globally using:

```
npm install -g ssdev
```
after which you can simply use it by typing
```
ssdev --help
```

### ðŸš€ Usage

ssdev assumes Silverstripe projects to be inside a directory containing a `composer.json`
file and a file structure [common for Silverstripe](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/getting_started/directory_structure/).
All commands concerning that project **must** be executed in the project root.

In a directory containing a project, simply run
```
ssdev up
```
to bring up a server and database environment. To shut down the server after you
are finished, run
```
ssdev down
```
There is more to ssdev, but we go over all of it in the [docs](#docs).

## ðŸ“– Docs
ssdev can be customized in various ways.
#### Config Options
You can set all config options (`ssdev --help`) in a `package.json` file under the
`ssdev` key. This allows you to set per-project settings that actually transfer
to other developers. An example would be if you want to use a different PHP version:
```json
{
  "ssdev": {
    "image-host": "syntrocontainer/silverstripe-dev:8.0-apache-buster"
  }
}
```

#### Configure the Host Container
